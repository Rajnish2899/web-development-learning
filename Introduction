**How does internet works ?**

Internet is like a long piece of wire with which different computers are connected . All computers talks 
to each other using this long wire . 

some of computers have a very special work and for that they have to be ON all the time.They are ready to 
serve all data-files which someone is requesting , these computers are called SERVERS .whose work is to
serve all data-files that is requested for , those who are requesting is  known as CLIENT.


when someone search for certain website , browser sent that request to ISP (INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER) 
these are they who pay to access the internet . So , browser send request that it want to access certain
website to ISP . ISP  send that request to DNS server (DOMAIN NAME SERVER) which can be understand as
PHONEBOOK.
DNS will start searching for the IP address of the website for which ISP has requested . After getting
that ip address in its database , DNS will return all data-files to the browser through ISP.

Server send data-files of website which is requested in three format html , css , javascript . Where HTML give the structure of the website , CSS is for decorating giving colors and style , and javascript is used to make it dynamic(functionality) .
